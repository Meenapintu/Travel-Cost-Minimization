suppose you are travelling from M to D in an electric car
which has a battery that can hold one Coulomb of charge on which it
can run 100 km.  You start with your car fully charged.  You are given
numbers D[1..n] and P[1..n] where D[i] denotes the distance of
the ith charging station from M, and P[i] the charging price
per Coulomb at the ith charging station.  If your battery currently
holds x coulombs, you may buy any amount of charge between 0 and
1-x coulombs.

Give an algorithm to decide where you will buy the charge, and how
much you will buy so as to minimize your total expense.  You can
assume that D[i] are given in increasing order, and that there are
sufficiently many charging stations that it is possible to make the
journey without running out of charge.

Input: given as n D[1] P[1] D[2] P[2] ... D[n] P[n]


out put is 
 total cost amount of fuel taken from each station :wq
